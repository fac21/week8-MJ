# README - Week 8

Week 8's [project brief](https://learn.foundersandcoders.com/course/syllabus/client-side-app/project/) was to use React to build an interactive game that uses data from an API.

## Team

[Mariya](https://github.com/mariyapeychinova) + [Jo](https://github.com/jamdelion)

## Concept

This week, we discovered about VS Code's collaboration tool, *Live Share*. When sharing an editor in a collaboration session for the first time, Mariya exclaimed "there's a ghost in my code!". And thus the project's idea was born! :baby_chick: 

Inspired by that 1980 classic arcade game, Pac-Man, this is...

###  :ghost: VS Code Live *Scare* !! :ghost: 

## How to Play

1. Go to [boo-lean-said-the-ghost.netlify.app](https://boo-lean-said-the-ghost.netlify.app)
2. Sign up with your GitHub username and click "Play".
3. Click on a ghost to kill it. :crossed_swords: 
4. The game is over when you've killed all the ghosts. :grimacing:

## Usage guidelines

- Clone this repo
- Run `npm run dev`
- Open `localhost:3000`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Accept some user input (e.g. a username)
- [x] Query an API (e.g. the Github API, or any other fun one)
- [x] Populate the UI with API data
- [x] Have some form of persistent state and interactivity, e.g. a hunger bar

### Stretch criteria

- [ ] Save your state to localstorage so you can leave the page and come back later.
- [x] Make it look great

### Additional stretch goals

- [ ] Make the ghosts move
- [ ] Glow effect around ghosts :sparkle: 
- [ ] Difficulty levels (number of ghosts)
