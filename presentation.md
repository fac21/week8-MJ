## Concept

<!-- This week, we discovered about VS Code's collaboration tool, *Live Share*. When sharing an editor in a collaboration session for the first time, I exclaimed "there's a ghost in my code!". And thus the project's idea was born! :baby_chick:  -->

"There's a ghost in my code!"

    - Mariya - 3.30-4pm
    - Jo - 3.00 - 3.30pm

## Deployment challenges

- Nested folders were a problem!
    - We added:
        - `npm run build` to the build command field
        - `dist` to the publish directory field
        - `./mj-app` to the base directory field

## Specific Code Challenges

- Incrementing the score (we needed to pass a function to setScore)

---

## Specific Code Challenges

- Keeping track of score state during the game
    - This is needed, to move the game to end-game state.

`console.log(gameState)`

`console.log(props.currentScore, numberNeededToWin)`
